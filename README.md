# Welcome

## Development

To start the development of this app, first you must install nodejs then just run
`npm install` and `npm run dev` in this directory

## Compiling

1. We use nexe to compile the node app into an executable, first install all the
   nexe prerequisites then run `npm run compile`
1. After that a `.exe` file will be generated in the `dist` directory
1. You can run the app by running `dist\app.exe`. This does not require any
   nodejs installation
